# AVL_tree
I have coded AVL binary tree. The most important thing of binary tree is to ensure that each node is balanced, because, the difference between binary tree and lineer linked-list appears in runtime analysis. If the binary tree is not balanced, it would be similar to the lineer linked-list. That's where the AVL trees come in to help us.
